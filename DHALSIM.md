## Corner Throw Loop: Yes
___
## Gameplan Notes
- Normals like `stMP`, `stHK`, and `stHP` are somewhat stuffable/whiff punishable with `crHP` -> `run` -> `Tatsu`.
- `crHP` can only be effectively whiff punished with `Sweep`. 
  - `Dragonlash` does jump over it.

___
## Punishable Normals
- `stMK` has an extended hurtbox that can be punish countered by `crLP` from quite far.

## crHP -> Slide / crHP
- This flowchart loses clean to `L Dragonlash`
  - Everything either gets counterhit, punish countered, or leaves Ken close and plus enough to get a `crLP` punish.
