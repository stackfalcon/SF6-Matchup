# GUILE

## Gameplan Notes
- Walk him down, parry `booms`. No need to waste meter on `EX Fireball` often.
- DO NOT let him out of the corner.
- Focus of whiff punishing his preemptive normals as he tries to keep you back.

## Punishable Normals
- `Forward Sobat` (`-6`) 
- `Upside Down Kick` (`-8`) 
  - `stMK` punish.
- `crMK` (`-5`)
  - `stLK` punish.
  - still `-1` during `Drive Rush`, can just hit `stLK`.
  - `crMK xx fMP` is also `-5`.
