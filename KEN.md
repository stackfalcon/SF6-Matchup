# KEN
## Corner Throw Loop: Yes
___
## Gameplan Notes
  - Don't forget about double `Perfect Parry` vs `EX Fireball`


___
## Jinrai
### `M Jinrai` can be fuzzy mashed on.
  - `7f` moves (Ken `crMK`) have a 5 frame gap to win cleanly on immediate timing.
  - Ken can delay `L` followup by up to 2 frames.
  - Mash `crMK` `4`-`6` frames after `Jinrai` blockstun goes away. React to `L` followup being blocked with `stLK`.  
  - No clean mash timing to punish empty `Jinrai` without risking getting hit.
