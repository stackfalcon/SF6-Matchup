## Gameplan Notes

- `stHP` seems to do well against his `stMK`.
_____
## Drive Rush stHP
- Big whiff recovery, loses to neutral jump on a read if they don't react with antiair.
- Pretty hard to stuff on reaction, `stLK` seems to be best from close up.
  - Need to react pretty quickly.
- `Perfect Parry` also works, however make sure to punish with something fast since the second hit can still stuff you.
_____
## Palm
- `Palms` are `-5`, unpunishable if spaced well though.
