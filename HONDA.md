## Gamplan Notes
- Keep in mind `EX Headbutt` loses to throw.
- Careful around his neutral jumps -- he can move forward while attacking.
_____
## Punishable Normals
- `fHK` can always be punished by `stLK xx HK Tatsu`.
_____
## Buttslam 
- `njHK` or `fjMP` wins.
- Possibly worth labbing hold `parry` -> `backdash` -> `DP`.
