## Burnout vs Spin Knuckle
- `L Spin` is `+1`, `M Spin` is like `+4`.
- `Lights xx Spin` can be interrupted, `Mediums xx Spin` cannot.

 ***After blocking spin knuckle, either:***

- Block her `crLP` then mash `crLP` to beat `lights` (range), `crMP`, and `...xx Spin` (speed)
- Mash immediately to beat `crMP xx Spin`

## Jab Strings

- `Cammy` has ZERO options to beat `stLK` after she does strings with 3 `light` normals. 
  - She HAS to block or cancel into something unsafe, even `Drive Rush` is too slow to counterhit.

## Divekick
- Best option seems to be to walk backwards and try to whiff punish/get pressure on reaction to it whiffing. 
- `stLP`/`crMP` `xx run -> Dragonlash` can net a big punish but needs to be done very early and loses to non-divekick jumps. Worth it when sure but not otherwise.  
- Walk forward block has the potential to mess up their timing but is risky.
