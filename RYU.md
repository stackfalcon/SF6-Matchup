## Gameplan Notes


___
## Donkey Kick
- `Sweep` / `stMK` punish badly spaced `M Donkey Kick` (`-8`) 
- `H Donkey Kick` is `-5`
- To whiff punish -- neutral `DR` xx `stLP` seems pretty decent. Hold parry until it comes out so you parry the strike if in range.

## Burnout stLP xx LP Hasho loop
- Not real, `LP Hasho` is `+-0` so just jab out.
___
