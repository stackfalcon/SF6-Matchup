# JP
## Corner Throw Loop: Yes
___
## Gameplan Notes
- Play in midrange! Don't give him fullscreen.
- Can rotate `Fireball`, `Stepkick`, `Drive Rush stLP`, `Dragonlash`.
- Can `Drive Rush` cancel `stLP` from fullscreen to work your way in here.
- React to `Trap` -> `Drive Rush` with `Sweep`.
- His specials are all minus except for `EX` and `236hp`.
_____
## Cane Sweep (3HP)
- This is `-14`, make sure to always punsih with `stHK`, it always reaches.
-----
## Anti Amnesia:
- `Drive Rush stLP` is `+8` after `Amnesia`, do one `stMK` to lock down and wait it out.
- immediate `stHK`->`Perfect Parry` works pretty well to mitigate risk midscreen(?)
- Meaty `Fireball` can't be countered
  - ...`run Tatsu` -> `backdash` -> `EX Hado` (`+7`)
  - ...`run DP` -> `L Hado` (`+-0`)
  - ...`M Jinrai, fHK` -> `Light DP` -> `stLP` -> `L Hado` (`+-0`)
_____
## Corner Oki vs Parry/Counter spam:
- Shimmy, react to drive bar going down with `Drive Impact` to punish both.
_____
## Trap -> Teleport:
- `Teleport` has JP spin his cane, react with `DP` / `crHP xx H Jinrai`.
- If `Teleport` is right above you, up/back `jMK` is the ony reliable answer.
_____
## Trap -> Drive Rush:
- This is only real if `trap` autodetonates, after `trap`->`snap` `Drive Rush` puts him at `-1` at the best.
_____
## H Spike:
- After `H Spike` you can `run` from fullscreen and `Tatsu` just about any special on reaction.
- After `H Spike` midscreen `run->Stepkick` becomes the more reliable option.
- `Dash` is 100% safe after blocking `Spike`
_____
## 236p:
- This blockstring ender can be `Drive Impacted` on reaction no matter how late.
- Both fast ones are at LEAST `-8`, `Shippu` can punish `236mp` at point blank 3 jabs range and `stHK` can lock down, both whiff at max range.
_____
## Command Grab:
- Jump forward `EX Tatsu` on reaction can help close the distance, `stMK` probably best followup whether it hits or whiffs.
_____
## EX Claw:
- Very plus, but if he goes immediately into `Trap` it can be punished on reaction via `Stepkick`.
   - `Dragonlash`es other than `H Dragonlash` can work as well however it seems like overall a worse option.
_____
## LV 2
- When done in neutral, parry first 2 hits then jump back works to mitigate mix
