# SF6 Matchup Notes


This repo is meant to be an easy to read/access hub of matchup notes I once kept on my phone. 

Feel free to steal tech, fork this repo for yourself, overthink matchups, and lose anyways (like I will). 

***Matchup notes are currently written around `Ken`'s options.***

## Future Additions
- Notes oriented around other characters as I learn them / if I switch mains


I'll probably also end up expanding this to include a ton of Tekken notes I have, but I don't have the energy for that right now.
