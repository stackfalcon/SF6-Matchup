CHUN
Tech:
- Stomp oki can be beaten by lp dp SOMETIMES on first stomp, needs more labbing
- likely to come after jump HH tc 

DEE JAY
Tech:
- Sway:
- LK Tatsu can punish empty sway and counter other options

Guile
General Notes:
- Walk him down, parry booms. No need to waste meter on EX boom often.
- DO NOT let him out of corner
- Focus of whiff punishing his preemptive normals as he tries to kepp you back

Tech:
- Forward sobat -6
- Upside down kick -8 
- stMK punish
- crMK -5 and still -1 when DR'd, can just hit stLK

HONDA
Tech:
- fHK can always be punished by stLK xx hk tatsu
- njHK or fjMP to beat buttslam

JAMIE
Tech:
- Palms are -5, unpunishable if spaced well though
- 5hp is good against his 5mk

JP
GENERAL NOTES:
- Play in midrange! Don't give him fullscreen
- Can rotate fireball, stepkick, DR jab, lash
- Can drive rush cancel jab from fullscreen to work your way in here
- React to trap -> DR with sweep
- His specials are all minus except for EX and 236hp

TECH:
- Anti Counter: 
- DR jab is +8 after counter, do one stMK to lockdown and wait it out
- immediate stHK->perfect parry? Works pretty well to mitigate risk midscreen
- Meaty fireball can't be countered
- ...run tatsu, backdash, 236pp +7
- ...run dp, immediate 236lp +-0
- ...mk jinrai ender, 623lp, stlp, 236lp +-0

- Corner Oki vs Parry/Counter spam
- Shimmy, react to drive bar going down with DI to punish both

- Trap -> Teleport:
- Teleport has JP spin his cane, react with DP/crHP xx H Jinrai.
- If TP is right above you, upback jMK is the ony reliable answer

- H Spike:
- After H Spike you can run from fullscreen and tatsu just about any special on reaction.
- After H Spike midscreen run->stepkick becomes more reliable option
- Dash fwd is 100% safe after blocking spike

- 236p:
- This blockstring ender can be DI'd on reaction no matter how late
- Both fast ones are at LEAST -8, Shippu can punish 236mp at point blank 3 jabs range and stHK can lock down, both whiff at max range

- Command Grab:
- Jump forward ex tatsu on reaction can help close the distance, stMK probably best followup whether hits or whiffs

- Ex Claw:
- Very plus, but if he goes immediately into trap it can be punished on reaction via LK/MK lash (lk more reliable but less range)

CAMMY

Tech:
- Burnout vs Spin Knuckle
- LP knuckle is +1, MP is like +4
- Lights xx knuckle can be interrupted, mediums xx knuckle cannot
- After blocking spin knuckle, either:
- Block her 2lp then mash 5lp to beat lights (range), 2mp, and xx knuckle (speed)
- Mash immediately to beat 2mp xx knuckle

LILY
Tech:
- Ex dp is only throw invuln
- Wind Charge:

- Perfect parry DR OS can help
